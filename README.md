# Odin Recipes

## What is this?
This is the first project ("Recipes") that I am making as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

I expect it to go well, as I already have familiarity with most of the topcis covered up to this point in the course. I have been using this course as a way to discover where my skills have gaps and need improvement.


## What skills will be demonstrated?
This project will essentially be a website of pure html. There is no CSS or JS involved yet. The pages will use as many of the html elements the course has covered in as creative ways as possible, with the goal of sharing recipes with the website visitor.

## How did it go?
(I will write this bit at the end!)
